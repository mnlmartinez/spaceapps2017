# [Nexus City- Valencia 2030](www.nexus-city.net)

The nexus city webpage was created during the 72 Hours hackathon organized by NASA in order to innovate and develop tommorows cities.
An idea gaining traction in the last 2 to 3 years. The simple web is meant as a first step for the project by the UPV Makers team. A
group of students from more than 10 different backgrounds. From engineering to architecture; all working together to make their ideas
a reality. The site can be visited at www.nexus-city.net
